# Coursera_Capstone
Capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate, (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).

Unfortunately, Github doesn't render Jupyter Notebooks, so to view, you need use Jupyter's nbviewer for this repo - https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dhunter/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/cluster_neighborhoods_toronto.ipynb
