Capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate.

Note: Unfortunately, Github doesn't render Jupyter Notebooks, so to view, you need to go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and then copy/paste in the URL to the appropriate file in this repo, (i.e. https://github.com/dhunter/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/cluster_neighborhoods_toronto.ipynb).
